    <string name="bio_text">These violent delights have violent ends. And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
And in the taste confounds the appetite.
Therefore love moderately. Long love doth so.Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.</string>
